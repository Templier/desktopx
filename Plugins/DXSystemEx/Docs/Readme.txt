=======================================================================================================
== Download
=======================================================================================================

SystemEx.StartDownload(id, remoteUrl, localPath)
-----------------------------------------------

Download a file to a local path, identified by id

SystemEx.StopDownload(id)
-------------------------

Stop a specific download

SystemEx_OnDownloadFinish(id, status, localPath)
------------------------------------------------

Received when a download has ended. See the list of status codes for more information


SystemEx_OnDownloadProgress(id, completedSize, totalSize)
---------------------------------------------------------

Received on download progress

SystemEx.LoadPage(remoteUrl, parameters)

Received on loadpage progress


=======================================================================================================
== Drag & Drop
=======================================================================================================

SystemEx_OnDropText(text)
-------------------------

Gets called when the user drops a text selection on the object


SystemEx_OnDropFiles(files)
---------------------------

Gets called when the user drops one or more files on the object. "files" will be an array of file names

Notes: 
 1. You don't need to set the layer to Accept Drag&Drop in the layer options.
 2. Your object will also be set to accept files. The normal Object_OnDropFiles callback will work as
usual (although provided by the plugin instead of DesktopX). You can also get an array of file names
instead of a |-separated list by implementing the SystemEx_OnDropFiles callback.



=======================================================================================================
== Instance
=======================================================================================================

SystemEx.CommandLine
--------------------

Get the full command line (including the path to the executable and DesktopX-specific arguments)


SystemEx.CommandLineArgs
------------------------

Get an array of command line arguments.
Command line arguments have been cleaned up to remove DesktopX-specific arguments (in the case of single-exe gadgets)

SystemEx.IsFirstInstance
------------------------

Will be True if this is the first instance to run, False otherwise.
It is preferable to check for it at startup and close the gadget accordingly,
as only the first instance will receive a callback message when a new instance is started.


SystemEx_OnNewInstance(commandLineArgs)
---------------------------------------

Gets called when another instance is started. The command line arguments are passed in an array.



=======================================================================================================
== Monitor Information
=======================================================================================================

SystemEx.Monitors
------------------

Gets an array of MonitorInfo objects


SystemEx.GetMonitor(index)
---------------------------

Returns the MonitorInfo for the given monitor


SystemEx.NumberOfMonitors
--------------------------

Gets the number of active monitors on the machine



=======================================================================================================
== Mousewheel
=======================================================================================================

SystemEx_OnMouseWheel(rotation)
----------------------------

When the mouse is over the object and the mousewheel is used, the SystemEx_OnMouseWheel
function will be called with the wheel rotation passed as a parameter.

The wheel rotation will be in number of lines.

Default value: 3
Default value for page scrolling: 10

A positive value indicates that the wheel was rotated forward, away from the user;
a negative value indicates that the wheel was rotated backward, toward the user.


SystemEx_OnMButtonDown(x, y) & SystemEx_OnMButtonUp(x, y, dragged)
---------------------------------------------------

When you middle click on your object, the SystemEx_OnMButtonDown function will be
called. When you release the button, the SystemEx_OnMButtonUp function will be called.

Both functions will have the mouse coordinates relative to your object passed as
parameters.


=======================================================================================================
== Signature
=======================================================================================================

Note: The only type of hash function supported at this time is SIGNATURE_SHA1


SystemEx.VerifyHash(path, hash, type)
-----------------------------------------------

Check the signature of the file pointed to by path.


SystemEx.GetHash(path, type)
---------------------------------

Get the hash of the file pointed to by path.


=======================================================================================================
== Touch
=======================================================================================================

SystemEx_OnGesture(info)
------------------------

Receive a GestureInfo object with information about the gesture.

Note: For the Press and Tap and Pan gestures, (X1, Y1) contain the delta between the two fingers and the
      inertia (if available) respectively

SystemEx_OnTouch(events)
------------------------

Receive an array of TouchInfo objects when a touch event happens


=======================================================================================================
== Volume
=======================================================================================================

SystemEx_OnVolumeEvent(volume)
------------------------------

When the user change the master volume through the volume mixer or another application
your object callback is called. The volume parameter will contain the current master
volume.

XP Compatibility: never called.


SystemEx_OnMuteEvent(isMuted)
-----------------------------

If the volume is muted, your object callback is called.
isMuted will be True if the volume has been muted, false otherwise.

XP Compatibility: never called.


SystemEx.Volume
---------------

Sets or gets the master volume.

Usage:
 SystemEx.Volume = <volume>
 vol = SystemEx.Volume

<volume> should be between 0 and 100. Any value outside these bounds will be capped.


SystemEx.Mute
-------------

Mute or Unmute the audio stream

Usage:
 SystemEx.Mute = True
 isMuted = SystemEx.Mute

Mute can take two values: True and False.
If Mute is True the audio stream is muted, otherwise it is not muted.


SystemEx.PeakValue
------------------

This is a read-only property. It allows you to get the peak level value for the
currently playing sample.

Usage:
	level = SystemEx.PeakValue

level will be between 0 and 100.

XP Compatibility: might not work with some cards, in which case it will always
			      returns 100.
			      It reads from the waveout device, so it won't work when
			      reading from a CD for example.
